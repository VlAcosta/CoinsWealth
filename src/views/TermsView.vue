                    <p>10.4. By purchasing internal tokens (such as LMT or any other) and investing in cryptocurrency tokens, you acknowledge and understand that these activities carry significant risks and are highly speculative in nature. These tokens are unregulated, operate in an early stage of development, utilize experimental software and business models, lack governmental protection for your investment, exhibit extreme price volatility, may have inadequate documentation, and pose a high risk of fraud.</p>
                    <p>10.5. It is important to note that the purchase of internal virtual tokens (such as LMT or others) or investment in cryptocurrency token projects should only be undertaken if you possess substantial technical knowledge and have a comprehensive understanding of the specific offering. Thorough due diligence should be conducted on the projects, networks, tokens, and teams associated with any token sale. It is crucial to recognize that your investment, as well as others', may not result in the acquisition of a usable or valuable token, and there is a possibility of losing the entire value of your investment.</p>
                    <p>10.6. Please be aware that the token sales discussed on the limercoin.com website have not undergone review by any regulatory authority.</p>
                    <p>10.7. The accuracy or sufficiency of the offering documents for token sales has not been confirmed or determined by regulatory authorities. Any claim to the contrary is considered a criminal offense.</p>
                    <p>10.8. Tokens may constitute securities pursuant to applicable security laws.</p>
                    <p>10.9. Tokens may not be suitable for or offered to investors residing in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cautioned investors residing in the United States that token sales may qualify as securities, and by investing in tokens, these investors may be participating in unregistered securities offerings. In the event of fraud or theft, US investors who invest in tokens may have limited or no recourse to recover any losses incurred.</p>
